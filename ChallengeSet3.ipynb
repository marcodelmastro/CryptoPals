    "**Adding a Cryptographic Hash to Outputs**\n",
    "\n",
    "By applying a cryptographic hash (like SHA-256 or SHA-3) to each tempered output, one effectively obscures the relationship between the internal state and the output. The cryptographic hash is designed to be one-way, so it becomes computationally infeasible for an attacker to reverse the hash and recover $z$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Introduce a Mixing Layer**\n",
    "\n",
    "After generating the random output $z$, one could pass it through a mixing layer that makes inversion infeasible. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use a keyed cryptographic function like AES:\n",
    "  $\\text{output} = \\text{AES}_{\\text{key}}(z)$\n",
    "  Without the key, the attacker cannot reverse the output back to \\( z \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Combine multiple outputs before releasing them:\n",
    "  $\n",
    "  \\text{output} = (z_1 \\oplus z_2) \\oplus z_3\n",
    "  $\n",
    "  This adds complexity to the recovery process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Periodic State Reseeding**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Periodically reseed the RNG state with entropy from a secure source (e.g., hardware RNG).\n",
    "- Even if an attacker partially recovers the state, the reseeding process disrupts their ability to predict future outputs."
